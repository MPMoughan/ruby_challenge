# Create an array of students and allow the user
# to keep adding new students to the array.
# After each student is added, display the array to
# the user (use the inspect method to display the array).
# If the user deciders to not add an additional student,
# display the list of the students and the index that each
# student is at (check out .each_with_index)

# Here is a sample prompt:

# Would you like to add another student?
# yes
# What is the student's name?
# Taco
# The array of instructors now looks like: ["Taco"]
# Would you like to add another student?
# no
# Here is a summary of your student array:
# The student at index 0 is Taco
